# Dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles and other configs I use when setting up a machine for the first time. Feel free to use and modify these materials.

## Terminal Config
I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html) as my terminal app. Defaults are in [iterm-default.json](/iterm-default.json). Current theme of choice is [cyberpunk](https://github.com/Murderlon/cyberpunk-iterm).

## IDE Config
I use Jetbrains editors. Current theme of choice is [Solarized Dark](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12112-solarized-theme).

## Other Software I Want On My Machines
When I set up a new machine, I generally want to install:
* [Time Out](https://www.dejal.com/timeout/) to make me take a damn break
* [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) for window management
* [Google Drive Backup and Sync](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) to sync my files
* Tools and Utils:
	* [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) (better `cat`)
	* [`htop`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/htop) (better `top`)
	* [`diff-so-fancy`](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) (cleaner diffs)
	* [`terminal-notifier`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/terminal-notifier) (systray notifications from terminal)
	* [`watch`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/watch#default) (run a program periodically and live update output)
